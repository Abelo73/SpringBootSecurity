# Spring Boot Basics with CRUD, Spring Security, and OAuth2

This is a sample Spring Boot project that demonstrates CRUD operations, Spring Security, and OAuth2 authentication.

## Features

- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entities using RESTful APIs.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
- Enable OAuth2 authentication with authorization code grant type.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- Integrate with a database for persistent storage (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2).

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and corresponding JDBC driver (if applicable)
